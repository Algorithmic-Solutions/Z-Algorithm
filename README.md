## Z-Algorithm 

This repository explores the Z-algorithm, a powerful string searching algorithm, and utilizes it for two practical applications: text summarization and text search with highlighting.

**What is the Z-algorithm?**

The Z-algorithm is a linear time algorithm used to efficiently find the longest prefix of a string that is also a suffix within the same string. This property allows it to tackle various string manipulation tasks with remarkable speed.

**Project Implementations:**

* **Text Summarization** -> [Implementation and explanation](Text%20Search%20with%20Highlighting/)
* **Text Search with Highlighting:** -> [Implementation and explanation](Text%20Search%20with%20Highlighting/)

**Contribution and Future Development:**

This repository is currently under development (WIP - Work in Progress). Feel free to explore the existing code and contribute your ideas for further development.  

* If you have suggestions for improving the Z-algorithm implementation, 
* have alternative approaches for text summarization or text search with highlighting using the Z-algorithm, or
* simply want to discuss these projects,
feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on this repository.
